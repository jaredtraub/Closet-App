# Closet-App
This web application was developed for my final project in 2024SP-IDEA-380A2-001: Design Thinking Toolbox: Artificial Intelligence at Colorado State University.

Its main purpose is to demonstrate the efficacy of the current state of generative Artificial Intelligence in a Software Development setting, specifically dealing with the developement of web applications.

In this project, I set out to design and develop a simple web application with the assistance of Generative AI tools, specifically OpenAI's ChatGPT, in all steps of the process, including the ideation, coding, and styling of the web application.


DISCLAIMER: I am by no means the first person to develop a virtual closet/random outfit generator. Majority of code used was written by/assisted by generative AI.
