# Closet-App
This web application was developed for my final project in 2024SP-IDEA-380A2-001: Design Thinking Toolbox: Artificial Intelligence at Colorado State University.

Its main purpose is to demonstrate the efficacy of the current state of generative Artificial Intelligence in a Software Development setting, specifically dealing with the developement of web applications.

In this project, I set out to design and develop a simple web application with the assistance of Generative AI tools, specifically OpenAI's ChatGPT, in all steps of the process, including the ideation, coding, and styling of the web application.

The web application is intended to solve the issue of lack of closet space, resulting in clutter due to clothing items being pulled out and left out of the closet. The application creates a virtualized version of my closet, allowing the user (myself) to scroll through my different clothing items, and view them together, without actually having to pull the item out of the closet. The application also include the feature to generate a random outfit, as well as save images of outfits that are generated.

DISCLAIMER: I am by no means the first person to develop a virtual closet/random outfit generator. Majority of code used was written by/assisted by generative AI.
